## 1.1.1 (2020-09-23)

This release is the same as v1.1.0, but the repo/package has been renamed from axe-storybook to axe-storybook-testing. The new name hopefully better reflects what it does.

## 1.1.0 (2020-09-23)

- [new] Start up Chromium with --force-prefers-reduced-motion, to help prevent animations from causing flakiness. Unfortunately, this doesn't do anything for Firefox or Webkit.

## 1.0.0 (2020-09-20)

v1 release! ðŸŽ‰

- [breaking] Rename `--build_dir` option to `--build-dir`
- [new] Improve performance by around 5x, by using Storybook's client API to render stories, instead of page navigations.
- [fix] Disable the 'bypass' rule by default.
- [fix] Force one call to `axe.run` to finish before the next can start, preventing [dequelabs/axe-core#1041](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/issues/1041) when things go wrong in a test.
- Update dependencies.
- Change the Mocha reporter to "spec".
- Add integration tests.
- Use types from @storybook/client-api, instead of writing our own, for story data.

## 0.3.0 (2020-09-17)

- [new] Add more information to the failure messages
- [fix] Improve performance by only injecting axe-core onto the page once (and not for every test).
- Update all dependencies

## 0.2.1 (2020-09-16)

- [new] Group checks by the stories's component title
- [fix] Ensure the top-level Mocha `describe` is displayed, by waiting to "write" the tests until the stories have been found

## 0.2.0 (2020-09-14)

- [breaking] Remove `--debug` option
- [new] Add `--headless` option (defaults to true)
- [new] Add `--browser` option (defaults to chromium. Accepts chromium, firefox, or webkit)
- [new] Display the violating html in results
- [fix] Don't log `undefined` to the console when there are test failures
- Switch to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), instead of Puppeteer
- Remove AxePuppeteer, and write our own AxePlaywright integration
- Write Mocha tests, instead of doing our own formatting of results

## 0.1.0 (2020-09-11)

Initial release!
